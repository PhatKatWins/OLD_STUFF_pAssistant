My first steps into .net, WPF and the MVVM model

A bare-bones app that stores account names and passwords
in a SQLite local database file, displays the date of creation
and last edit, and allows you to retrieve both the account name and password
for an entry. When clicked, either of the retrieve buttons store the
data on the clipboard, so that you can paste it into the required field of 
whatever you are logging into.
